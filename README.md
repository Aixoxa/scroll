<h2>üöÄ Installation</h2>

```
# clone with https
git clone https://github.com/napindic/scroll

# or clone with ssh
git clone git@github.com:napindc/scroll.git

cd scroll

pip install -r requirements.txt

~/scroll$ python run_swaps.py --wallets WALLET_KEY1 WALLET_KEY2 WALLET_KEYN
```

<>üö® Features</h2>

* emables running automated trades on multiple websites as a single python command
* accepts a single or multiple wallet private keys to perform swaps
* uses a dynamically randomizing schedule to execute trades and recycle wallets
* easily configurable - command line arguments expose the abilty to change the randomization schedules, amount to swap, and token to swap
* automatically cycles between swapping from ETH to USDC and then back from USDC to ETH

<h2>‚öôÔ∏è Settings</h2>

1) All setting are set at the command line, they can be shown again with the command:
```
$ python run_swaps.py -h
```

Note: the script has reasonable defaults

2) The rpc.json file at the path domain/data/rpc.json we can change the rpc to a personal or private rpc

---
<h2>Default Settings</h2>

By default this script will execute the following:

* 4 swaps per cycle on Skydrome, Zebra, SyncSwap, and XYSwap
* Randomize execution with between 5-20 minutes between websites, 20-30 minutes between wallets, and a random number of minutes less than 90 after 12 hours before recycle the wallets in the reverse direction
* starts swapping from USDC to ETH before reversing after the first cycle and waits complete
